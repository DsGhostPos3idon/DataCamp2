Link: https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/dax-functions-in-power-bi

## **Course Description**

DAX, or Data Analysis eXpressions, is a formula language used in Microsoft Power BI to create calculated columns, measures, and custom tables. Once mastered, DAX gives you powerful control over visuals and reports, allowing for better performance and more flexibility. This course covers the core concepts such as row query and filter context, with exercises focusing on filtering, counting, ranking, and iterating functions.

## **Course Structure**

| â„– | Module | Description |
| - | - | - |
| 1 | Setting up Data Models with DAX | In this chapter, you'll write custom functions to create new tables and calculated columns |
| 2 | DAX and Measures | In this chapter, you'll write custom functions to create calculated measures. You'll also get introduced to variables to make writing DAX functions more efficient |
| 3 | Filtering and Counting with DAX | Expand your DAX power with some commonly used DAX measures. This chapter focuses on filtering and counting functions |
| 4 | Iterating Functions | This chapter covers the core concept of another powerful set of DAX functions, the so called iterating functions. You will explore iterations with exercises focusing on ranking and iterating your data |
