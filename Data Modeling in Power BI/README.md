## **Course Description**

Proper data modeling is the foundation of data analysis and creating reports in Power BI. This course lets you explore a toolbox of data cleaning, shaping, and loading techniques, which you can apply to your data. You'll get to know how to choose between Power Query and Power BI, and discover the foundations of data modeling by going into star and snowflake schemas. You'll apply all of this to real-world datasets issued by the United States Census Bureau.
