## **Course Description**

In this course, you’ll extend your knowledge about facts, dimensions, and their relationships. You learn about the cardinality of relationships and how you can use bi-directional cross-filtering in your model. You’ll also explore the use of quick measures and hierarchies and write DAX to fully customize your data model. Finally, you’ll get introduced to Power BI reporting best practices to improve the performance of your reports.
