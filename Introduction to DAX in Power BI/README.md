## **Course Description**

Start your journey to becoming a DAX master with this introductory course on DAX. You’ll learn fundamental concepts and best practices for implementing DAX in your reports. You’ll learn to write DAX code to generate calculated columns, measures, and tables while learning supporting knowledge around ‘context’ in Power BI. Finally, we’ll round off the course by introducing time-intelligence functions and show you how to use Quick Measures to create complex DAX code. Let’s take the first step in your DAX mastery journey!

## **Course Structure**

| № | Module | Description |
| - | - | - |
| 1 | Getting Started with DAX | In this chapter, you’ll learn how to create custom calculations using Microsoft’s formula language, DAX (Data Analysis Expressions). You’ll learn how to expand your source tables with calculated columns, before progressing to writing calculated measures to help summarize your data |
| 2 | Context in DAX Formulas | In this chapter, you'll learn about context in Power BI and how it plays an important part when building reports. Next, we'll learn how to use iterator functions to evaluate data at a row level. We'll then introduce you to the CALCULATE function to help you filter your data and finally, we'll show you how to use variables to make writing DAX functions more efficient | 
| 3 | Working with Dates | In this chapter, you'll learn the power of DAX's date and time intelligence functions. You'll be able to use these functions in actions, as well as use quick measures to create complex DAX code |
