# **Intermediate DAX in Power BI**

Link: [https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/intermediate-data-modeling-in-power-bi](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/intermediate-dax-in-power-bi)

## **Course Description**

This course introduces you to new DAX functions and its many use cases. First of all, you expand your core DAX knowledge by learning how to write logical functions. Secondly, you’ll discover how you can write DAX functions for row-level security (RLS) purposes and how to use DAX to manipulate tables and create nested functions. Those time-intelligence quick measures will be building themselves before you know it!

## **Course Structure**

| № | Module | Description |
| - | - | - |
| 1 | Logical Functions | In this chapter, you'll dive into logical functions! You’ll learn how to combine IF with other Power BI functions and discover the robust SWITCH function |
| 2 | Row-level Security | In the second chapter, you'll learn about row-level security, allowing you to change what data users see depending on their roles and permissions |
| 3 | Table Manipulation Functions | In this chapter, you'll learn table manipulation functions in DAX. Let's summarize! |
| 4 | Time Intelligence Functions | In this last chapter, you'll expand your DAX knowledge with time intelligence functions. You'll even explore a way to create advanced visuals without writing DAX |
