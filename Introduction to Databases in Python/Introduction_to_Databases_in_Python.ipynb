It's the opposite of creating a Table by hand and is very useful for working with existing databases.\n",

During reflection, the MetaData object will be populated with information about the reflected table automatically, so we only need to initialize it before reflecting by calling MetaData().\n",

Then, you use this Table object to read your table from the engine, autoload the columns, and populate the metadata. This can be done with a single call to Table(): using the Table object in this manner is a lot like passing arguments to a function. For example, to autoload the columns with the engine, you have to specify the keyword arguments autoload=True and autoload_with=engine to Table().\n",
